# 1. Introduction
[The introduction of the Software Development Plan provides an overview of the entire document. It includes the purpose, scope, definitions, acronyms, abbreviations, references, and overview of this Software Development Plan.]

## 1.1 Purpose
[Specify the purpose of this Software Development Plan. The text below is provided as an example. ]

The purpose of the Software Development Plan is to gather all information necessary to control the project. It describes the approach to the development of the software and is the top-level plan generated and used by managers to direct the development effort.  of individual iterations will be described in Iteration Plans.  

The following people use the Software Development Plan:
- The project manager uses it to plan the project schedule and resource needs, and to track progress against the schedule.
- Project team members use it to understand what they need to do, when they need to do it, and what other activities they are dependent upon.

# 4. Management Process

## 4.1 Project Estimates
[Provide the estimated cost and schedule for the project, as well as the basis for those estimates, and the points and circumstances in the project when re-estimation will occur.] 

---

## 4.2 Project Plan
[This section contains the schedule and resources for the project.]Project artifact as well as iteration schedules] 

### 4.2.1 Phase Plan
[Include the following:
- a Gantt chart showing the allocation of time to the project phases (Not necessarily detailed to the activity level; this type of Gantt Chart is providing along with the Iteration Plans themselves; Provide an Overview of the project Timeline with the major miles stones]
- identify major milestones with their achievement criteria
Define any important release points and demos.]
[If available, refer to the related Iteration Plan Documents for more details]

### 4.2.2 Iteration Objectives
[Briefly list the objectives to be accomplished for each of the iterations and Refer to the related Iteration Plan Documents for more details.]

### 4.2.3 Releases
[A brief description of each software release and whether it’s demo, beta, and so on.]

### 4.2.4 Project Schedule
[Diagrams or tables showing target dates for completion of iterations and phases, release points, demos, and other milestones.] [Limit to major project milestone, e.g., requirements, design, implementaiotn, and testing]

### 4.2.5 Project Resourcing
[Identify the numbers and type of staff required here, including any special skills or experience, scheduled by project phase or iteration.

List any special training project team members will require, with target dates for when this training should be completed.]

## 4.3 Project Monitoring and Control
[The following is a checklist of items to consider:
- Requirements Management: Specify the information and control mechanisms which will be collected and used for measuring, reporting, and controlling changes to the product requirements.
- Quality Control: Describe the timing and methods to be used to control the quality of the project deliverables and how to take corrective action when required. Include techniques, metrics, criteria, and procedures used for evaluation— this will include walkthroughs, inspections, and reviews. Note that this is in addition to the Test Plan, which is not enclosed in the Software Development Plan.
- Reporting and Measurement: Describe reports to be generated. Specify which metrics should be collected and why. OR if available, refer to the Project Measurements and Project Measurements document
- Risk Management: Describe the approach that will be used to identify, analyze, prioritize, monitor and mitigate risks.  If available, refer to the Risk List document.
- Configuration Management: Describe the process by which problems and changes are submitted, reviewed, and dispositioned. Describe how project or product artifacts are to be named, marked, and numbered, including  system software, plans, models, components, test software, results and data, executables, and so on. Describe retention policies, and the back-up, disaster, and recovery plans.  OR if Available, Refer to the Configuration Management Plan document
The text that follows is provided as an example.]

### 4.4 Requirements Management
The requirements for this system are captured in the Vision document. Requested changes to requirements are captured in Change Requests, and are approved as part of the Configuration Management process.

### 4.5 Quality Control
Defects will be recorded and tracked as Change Requests, and defect metrics will be gathered (see Reporting and Measurement below).

All deliverables are required to go through the appropriate review process, as described in the Development Case. The review is required to ensure that each deliverable is of acceptable quality, using guidelines and checklists. 

Any defects found during review which are not corrected prior to releasing for integration must be captured as Change Requests so that they are not forgotten. 

### 4.6 Reporting and Measurement
Updated schedule estimates, and metrics summary reports, will be generated at the end of each iteration. 

The Minimal Set of Metrics, as described in the RUP Guidelines: Metrics will be gathered on a weekly basis.  These include: 

Earned value for completed tasks. This is used to re-estimate the schedule and budget for the remainder of the project, and/or to identify need for scope changes. 

Total defects open and closed – shown as a trend graph. This is used to help estimate the effort remaining to correct defects. 

Acceptance test cases passing – shown as a trend graph. This is used to demonstrate progress to stakeholders.

Refer to the Project Measurements Document (AAA-BBB-X.Y.doc) for detailed information.

### 4.7 Risk Management
Risks will be identified in Inception Phase using the steps identified in the RUP for Small Projects activity “Identify and Assess Risks”. Project risk is evaluated at least once per iteration and documented in this table.

Refer to the Project Measurements Document (AAA-BBB-X.Y.doc) for detailed information.

### 4.8 Configuration Management
Appropriate tools will be selected which provide a database of Change Requests and a controlled versioned repository of project artifacts.

All source code, test scripts, and data files are included in baselines. Documentation related to the source code is also included in the baseline, such as design documentation. All customer deliverable artifacts are included in the final baseline of the iteration, including executables.

The Change Requests are reviewed and approved by one member of the project, the Change Control Manager role.

Refer to the Project Measurements Document (AAA-BBB-X.Y.doc) for detailed information.
