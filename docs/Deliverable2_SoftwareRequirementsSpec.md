# 1. Introduction
[The introduction of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) provides an overview of the entire SRS. It includes the purpose, scope, definitions, acronyms, abbreviations, references, and overview of the SRS.]

[Note: The SRS captures the complete software requirements for the system, or a portion of the system. Following is a typical SRS outline for a project using use-case modeling. This artifact consists of a package containing use cases of the use-case model and applicable Supplementary Specifications and other supporting information.]

[Many different arrangements of an SRS are possible. Refer to [IEEE830-1998] for further elaboration of these explanations, as well as other options for SRS organization.]


## 1.1 Purpose
[Specify the purpose of this SRS. The SRS fully describes the external behavior of the application or
subsystem identified. It also describes nonfunctional requirements, design constraints, and other factors
necessary to provide a complete and comprehensive description of the requirements for the software.]


## 1.2 Scope
[A brief description of the software application that the SRS applies to, the feature or other subsystem
grouping, what Use-Case model(s) it is associated with, and anything else that is affected or influenced by
this document.]


## 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
[This subsection provides the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly
interpret the SRS. This information may be provided by reference to the project’s Glossary.]


## 1.4 References
[This subsection provides a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the SRS. Identify each
document by title, report number if applicable, date, and publishing organization. Specify the sources
from which the references can be obtained. This information may be provided by reference to an appendix
or to another document.]


## 1.5 Overview
[This subsection describes what the rest of the SRS contains and explains how the document is organized.]

# 2. Overall Description
[This section of the SRS describes the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This
section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements,
which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier to understand. Include such items as:


## 2.1 Product perspective


### 2.1.1 System Interfaces


### 2.1.2 User Interfaces


### 2.1.3 Hardware Interfaces


### 2.1.4 Software Interfaces


### 2.1.5 Communication Interfaces


### 2.1.6 Memory Constraints


### 2.1.7 Operations


## 2.2 Product functions


## 2.3 User characteristics


## 2.4 Constraints


## 2.5 Assumptions and dependencies


## 2.6 Requirements subsets

---

# 3. Specific Requirements
[This section of the SRS contains all software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable
designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those
requirements. When using use-case modeling, these requirements are captured in the Use Cases and the
applicable supplementary specifications. If use-case modeling is not used, the outline for supplementary
specifications may be inserted directly into this section, as shown below.]


## 3.1 Functionality
[This section describes the functional requirements of the system for those requirements that are expressed
in the natural language style. For many applications, this may constitute the bulk of the SRS package and
thought should be given to the organization of this section. This section is typically organized by feature,
but alternative organization methods may also be appropriate; for example, organization by user or
organization by subsystem. Functional requirements may include feature sets, capabilities, and security.

Where application development tools, such as requirements tools, modeling tools, and the like, are
employed to capture the functionality, this section of the document would refer to the availability of that
data, indicating the location and name of the tool used to capture the data.]


### 3.1.1 \<Functional Requirement One\>
[The requirement description.]


## 3.2 Use-Case Specifications
[In use-case modeling, the use cases often define the majority of the functional requirements of the system,
along with some non-functional requirements.]


## 3.3 Supplementary Requirements
[Supplementary Specifications capture other requirements, e.g., non-functional requirements and
development constraints, that are not included in the use cases and non-functional requirements.]

---

# 4. Classification of Functional Requirements
[List, usually in a table, all functional requirements and order them by Type (Essential, Desirable, and
Optional) or by order of appearance in the document.]

| Functionality | Type |
|------------------------|-------|
| ... | |
| ... | |

---

# 5. Appendices
[When appendices are included, the SRS should explicitly state whether or not the appendices are to be
considered part of the requirements]
